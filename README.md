# pokemonbattle

  This is a recreation of the turn-based combat system implemented in the 
  popular video game series Pokemon. It currently allows you to take control
  of two separate trainers and their partys and simulate a pokemon battle.

# Current Version (v7.4)

  - All types supported
  - Type advantages and disadvantages
  - Same type attack bonus implemented (STAB)
  - Multi-type Pokemon 
  - Stat Stages 
  - Lethal Status Effects 
  - Non-Lethal Status Effects (confusion only supported so far)
  - Many move abilities (more to be supported later, check Moves folder for supported moves)

# Goals
  - Make status effects into their own class
  - Create A.I for computer player 
  - Add support for more moves 
  - Create database / factory for creating pokemon
  - Possibly add G.U.I (?)
  - Possibly add Pokemon Abilities (?) 
  
# Project Details
  
  This project is one of my first ambitious / personal undertakings. I'm a big
  fan of Pokemon and thought it'd be a great learning experience to take on 
  recreating a complex turn-based-combat system. If anyone wants to contribute or
  help to design the A.I for the computer player, they're more than welcome.
