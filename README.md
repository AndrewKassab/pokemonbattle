# pokemonbattle

  This project is a simulation of the battle system implemented in the 
  popular video game series Pokemon. It currently allows you to take control
  of two separate trainers and their partys and simulate a pokemon battle.
  
# Project Details
  
  This project is one of my first ambitious / personal undertakings. I'm a big
  fan of Pokemon and thought it'd be a great learning experience to take on 
  recreating a complex turn-based-combat system. 
  
# What I learned

  - Create and manage multiple classes and objects in one program
  - Write clean and efficient code with documentation
  - Setting clear goals for each version of the program 
  - Creating efficient methods with a clear purpose to make more functional code
  - Creating specific behaviors for specific instances of an object
  - Efficiently debugging a program and pinpointing / documenting bugs. 
  - Multiple function calls from within other functions.
  - Using booleans to set states for specific objects and whether methods should be execured. 
 
# Currently Has

  - All Types supported
  - Type advantages
  - Same Type Attack Bonus
  - Multi-type Pokemon 
  - Stat Stages
  - Status Effects
  - Move abilities (more to be supported later)

# Goals

  - Create A.I for computer player 
  - Add support for more moves 
  - Possibly add G.U.I (?)
  - Possibly add Pokemon Abilities (?)
